    layoutupdater(;kwargs...)

A LayoutUpdater component.
LayoutUpdater is a component which updates the trace-data of a plotly graph.
Keyword arguments:
- `id` (String; optional): The ID used to identify this component in Dash callbacks.
- `gdID` (String; required): The id of the graph-div whose traces should be updated.

.. Note:

  * if you use multiple graphs; each graph MUST have a unique id; otherwise we
    cannot guarantee that resampling will work correctly.
  * LayoutUpdater will determine the html-graph-div by performing partial matching
    on the "id" property (using `gdID`) of all divs with classname="dash-graph".
    It will select the first item of that match list; so if multiple same
    graph-div IDs are used, or one graph-div-ID is a subset of the other (partial
    matching) there is no guarantee that the correct div will be selected.
- `sequentialUpdate` (Bool; optional): Bool indicating whether the figure should be redrawn sequentially (i.e.)
calling the restyle multiple times or at once.
(still needs to be determined which is faster has the lowest memory peak),
by default False.
- `updateData` (Array; optional): The data to update the graph with, must contain the `index` property for
each trace; either a list of dict-traces or a single trace
